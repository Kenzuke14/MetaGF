		<h2>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h2>
		<p>
			
			SAHC is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Polygon network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to exchange digital
			collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private MATIC wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. As the SAHC smart contract runs on the Polygon network, there is no ability to reverse, undo or restore any transactions.
		</p>
		<p>
			
			This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without a warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving SAHC digital collectibles.
		</p>
		<h2>
		
		OWNERSHIP
		</h2>
		<p>
			
			i. You Own the NFT. Each Sheep is an NFT on Polygon. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Sheep, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the MATIC Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any SAHC.
		</p>
		<p>
			
			ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, © SAHC grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use;
		</p>
		<p>
			
			(ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your SAHC / NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each SAHC owner’s rights to display the Art for their SAHC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your SAHC, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each SAHC owner’s rights to display the Art for their SAHC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible
			once the owner of the SAHC leaves the website/application.
		</p>
		<p>
			
			iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, © SAHC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to prevent you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of SAHC generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each SAHC owner’s rights to display the Art for their SAHC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of SAHC generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each SAHC owner’s rights to display the Art for their SAHC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased SAHC leaves the application/website; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.
